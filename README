This code is almost completely taken from plotutils-2.5:
http://www.gnu.org/software/plotutils/. Major reasons to
place the code into separate project are to reduce the size
of the source and to be able to post it on github web repository
under XODE name (and not xplotutils or the like).

The ODE language lacks such features as functions and the ability
to print expressions and not only symbols. XODE fixes that.
