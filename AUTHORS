From plotutils-2.5/AUTHORS:

	Rob Maier <rsm@math.arizona.edu> wrote the libplot/libplotter library and
	the graphics programs graph, plot, tek2plot, and plotfont, beginning in
	1995.  The old `GNU graphics' package (written by Rich Murphey
	<rich@freebsd.org> in 1989-1991) served as a starting point, but the
	plotutils package is at least an order of magnitude larger.  Probably none
	of the code from the earlier package remains in libplot/libplotter or the
	graphics programs.

	ode was written by Nick Tufillaro <nbt@reed.edu> in 1978-1994, and has been
	somewhat modified and extended so as to merge it into the package.
